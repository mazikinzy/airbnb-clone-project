# Feature Breakdown
### **API Documentation**
**OpenAPI Standard**  
OpenAPIStandard is a widely adopted specification for describing RESTful APIs in a machine-readable format using JSON or YAML. It defines the structure of an API — including endpoints, request/response formats, authentication, and error handling so that both humans and software tools can understand and interact with the API without needing access to the source code.
In this booking system project, OpenAPI Standard will play a crucial role in streamlining the development, improved testing and seamless integration of this project.

**Django REST Framework**  
Django REST Framework is a powerful and flexible toolkit built on top of Django for creating Web APIs. It simplifies the process of building RESTful services by providing:  
Serialization: *Converts complex data types (like Django models) into JSON and vice versa.*  
Authentication & Permissions: *Built-in support for token-based auth, OAuth, and custom permission classes.*  
Browsable API: *A web interface for testing and interacting with your API.*  
Generic Views & ViewSets: *Prebuilt logic for common CRUD operations.*  
Validation: *Automatic input validation through serializers.*  

**GraphQL**  
GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need.  
In this booking system project, GraphQL will facilitata services like customizable queries, nested data retrieval, real-time updates, and unified data access

### **User Authentication**
Endpoints: */users/, /users/{user_id}/*  
Features: *Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.*

### **Property Management**
Endpoints: */properties/, /properties/{property_id}/*  
Features: *Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.*

### **Booking System**
Endpoints: */bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}/*  
Features: *Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.*

### **Payment Processing**
Endpoints: */payments/*  
Features: *Handle payment transactions related to bookings.*

### **Review System**
Endpoints: */reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}/*  
Features: *Post and manage reviews for properties.*

### **Database Optimizations**
Indexing: *Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.*  
Caching: *Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.*

# API Security
Securing a booking system API is essential to protect user data, ensure system integrity, and maintain trust.  
Here are the key security measures and why each is crucial.  

**Authentication and Authorization**  
*Verifying user identity (authentication) and controlling access based on roles (authorization).*  
*Prevents unauthorized users from accessing sensitive endpoints like booking creation, cancellation, or admin dashboards.*

**Input Validation and Sanitization**  
*Ensuring all incoming data (e.g., booking dates, user info) is clean and conforms to expected formats.*  
*Protects against injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection) and data corruption.*

**Rate Limiting and Throttling**  
*Restricting the number of requests a user or IP can make in a given time.*  
*Prevents abuse, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and brute-force attempts on login or booking endpoints.*

**Secure API Key Management**  
*Safeguarding API keys using tools like AWS Secrets Manager, rotating keys regularly, and avoiding hardcoding.*  
*Compromised keys can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.*

**Data Encryption (TLS & at rest)**  
*Encrypting data during transmission (TLS 1.3+) and while stored (AES-256).*  
*Ensures confidentiality of sensitive data like payment details and personal information.*

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
*Assigning permissions based on user roles (e.g., guest, admin, staff).*  
*Limits exposure of critical operations and data to only authorized personnel.*

**Logging and Monitoring**  
*Tracking API usage, login attempts, and suspicious behaviour.*  
*Enables early detection of breaches, misuse, and performance issues.*

**Error Handling and Response Management**  
*Avoiding detailed error messages that reveal system internals.*  
*Prevents attackers from gaining insights into API structure or vulnerabilities.*

**Security Testing and Audits**  
*Regular penetration testing, code reviews, and vulnerability scans.*  
*Identifies and fixes security gaps before they’re exploited.*  

These measures will collectively ensure that the booking system is resilient against threats, compliant with data protection regulations, and trusted by users.
